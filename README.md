# Goals

This is a very simple particle system simulation
just to become more familiar with lua language


### TODO:
    - System:
        - Add sytle and linting checkers in github actions
        - Make it distributable somehow
        - Move TODOs to issues instead ;) 

    - Logic:
        - Make proper saving/loading system
        - Make pause in simulation
        - Make system dynamic

        - Check files todos also
